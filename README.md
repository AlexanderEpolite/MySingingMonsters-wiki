# Unofficial MSM Wiki

This project is in very early stages of development.  Please contribute by editing the files.

Under app/data/monsters.ts (a VERY large file), you may edit the data of monsters.  Ensure it follows the correct schema please!

There are other files in `data` as well you can modify, and many parts of the game are straight up missing.  Please feel free to
add them.  Contributors will get a special role on the Discord server.

## End Goal

The end goal of this project is to create a My Singing Monsters wiki separate from Fandom.

The website will not have advertisements (mostly so BBB doesn't shut it down), and will be
entirely community-made, with a custom frontend built specifically for this website.
